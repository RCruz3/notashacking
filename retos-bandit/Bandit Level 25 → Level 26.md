Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)
